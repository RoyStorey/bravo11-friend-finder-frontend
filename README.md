# Backend Integration

This app was made with a separate backend repo. The repo for the backend is [here](https://github.com/R3vanchist/team-builder/)

Separate deployment instructions are found there.

## How to run front-end

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

This will install all of the dependencies for the front-end.

### `change the .env to match your environment variables`

Change the .env to match your environment's setup. Provided is a .env.template file to show what an example template would look like.
